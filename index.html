                CSS has grown from a language for formatting documents into a
                robust language for designing web applications. 
                Its syntax is easy to learn, making CSS a great entry 
                point for those new to programming. Indeed, it’s often 
                the second language that developers learn, right behind HTML.

                Mastering CSS development also means learning how to work with 
                new tools such as linters and optimizers. Linters inspect your 
                code for potential trouble spots. Optimizers improve CSS quality, 
                and reduce the number of bytes delivered to the browser. 
                And of course, there’s the question of CSS architecture: 
                which selectors to use, how to modularize files, and how to 
                prevent selector creep.
